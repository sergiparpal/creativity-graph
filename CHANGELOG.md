# Changelog

All notable changes to the **creativity-graph** Claude Code plugin are recorded here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); `version` is set to `0.1.0` in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the matching `marketplace.json` entry.

The plugin turns a non-self-grounding conceptual document into a grounded, queryable knowledge
graph: a human-editable Markdown **canon** (the single source of truth, §1.2), a span-present
write **boundary**, a **grounding loop** with memory of failures, and a regenerable
NetworkX/SQLite **derived** layer. The deterministic Python engine (`scripts/kg_engine`) does the
hard guarantees; the Claude Code session and its subagents do the language work and hand structured
JSON back across the MCP boundary.

## [Unreleased]

The initial end-to-end build, staged per the implementation plan (§5). Engine: **53 tests green**.
Components: **5 agents, 5 commands**, 1 skill (+3 on-demand references), the `SessionStart`/`PreToolUse`
hooks, and the `creativity-graph` MCP server. Each stage advanced on its own automated exit test (§4).
The plugin was then **installed locally and the full workflow run end-to-end** (see *Packaging hardening
+ live validation* below).

### Stage 0 — Scaffold + environment bootstrap

- Added the plugin manifest `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with the `userConfig` enable-time prompts:
  `domain` (default "conceptual theory"), `source_path`, `sensitivity` (`low|medium|high`, default
  `medium`), `metrics_mode` (`structure_only|with_embeddings`, default `structure_only`).
- Added `.mcp.json` registering one server `creativity-graph`, launched with `uv run` against the
  persistent data dir, exporting `KG_PROJECT_DIR=${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` and `KG_DATA=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`.
- Added `pyproject.toml` (uv-managed engine deps) and the `SessionStart` bootstrap
  (`hooks/bootstrap.sh`): diff the bundled `pyproject.toml` against the copy in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`
  and run `uv sync` only on difference, so the venv installs once and re-syncs only on dependency changes.
- Stubbed `scripts/kg_engine/server.py` exposing `mcp__creativity-graph__kg_ping` →
  `{name, version, metrics_mode, sensitivity, pack_loaded}`.
- **Exit test:** `claude plugin validate ./creativity-graph --strict` passes; the plugin loads and
  `kg_ping` returns the version.

### Stage 1 — Canon + transactional writes + lease lock + reconciler

- `scripts/kg_engine/model.py`: the three orthogonal axes (`Provenance`, `AuthoredBy`,
  `EpistemicState`, §1.3) plus `Disposition`, `Confidence`; `Node`/`Edge` dataclasses; deterministic
  `edge_id(src, rel, tgt)` = `e_{source}__{relation}__{target}` (slugged); `normalize_text`,
  `span_verifies`, and Markdown frontmatter (de)serialization.
- `scripts/kg_engine/canon.py`: one Markdown note per node with three-axis frontmatter and an `edges:`
  block. Single-file writes are temp-file + atomic `os.rename`; multi-file mutations use
  git-as-rollback (`git stash push -u` before `git reset --hard HEAD`, preserving parallel human
  edits and surfacing the stash). Reclaimable `LeaseLock` (`acquire`/`heartbeat`/`release`/`is_stale`).
- `scripts/kg_engine/reconciler.py`: `mtime`/`size` pre-filter backed by a periodic full re-hash
  sweep (the sweep defeats mtime spoofing, §1.8); re-validates out-of-band changes through the
  boundary; `reattach_after_reproject` re-attaches grounding verdicts to surviving edges and surfaces
  orphaned verdicts. **An out-of-band `epistemic_state` transition (a forged verdict) is re-quarantined.**
- **Exit test:** `pytest tests/test_chaos.py` — crash-mid-write recovers via git, a stale lock is
  always reclaimed, an out-of-band verdict edit is re-quarantined on reconcile.

### Stage 2 — Domain pack + glossary

- Authored `pack/pack.yaml` from `examples/source.md`: node types
  `compression, primitive, claim, metric, operation, failure`; edge types
  `grounds, attacked_by, reconciles_with, bridges, collapses_into, confounded_by, approximates,
  defends_against, projects, survives`; a glossary of defined terms; and per-term `specificity_seeds`
  (IDF-like hints so vague terms are not mistaken for bridges, §1.6).
- Added `pack/glossary.md`.
- `scripts/kg_engine/pack.py`: `PackContract` (Pydantic), `load_pack`, and `coverage(pack, source_text)`.
  Types outside the pack route to the `undeclared-type` bucket — never silently accepted.
- **Exit test:** `python -m kg_engine.pack validate pack/pack.yaml [source.md]` passes `PackContract`
  and reports glossary coverage of the source's defined terms.

### Stage 3 — Staged extractor + boundary + PII scrubber

- `scripts/kg_engine/scrub.py`: `Scrubber(sensitivity)` redacts secrets/keys (always) and PII (per
  `sensitivity`) using consistent placeholders that preserve relational structure
  (`⟦PERSON:1⟧ attacked_by ⟦PERSON:2⟧`); the mapping stays local and `restore` rebuilds the original
  for span verification (§1.9). The scrub protects egress, not the local canon.
- The egress scrub is now wired into the live path: a new `mcp__creativity-graph__kg_scrub` tool runs
  the §1.9 egress redaction with consistent placeholders (`⟦SECRET:1⟧` etc.) before text reaches a
  subagent, and `kg_write` restores placeholder spans to the original for the canon (the boundary
  stores the restored original span). The MCP tool surface is now **eleven** tools.
- `scripts/kg_engine/boundary.py`: strict Pydantic `WritePayload`/`NodeIn`/`EdgeIn` (extra fields
  forbidden) and `validate_payload(...) -> [ValidationResult]`. Enforces span-present (§1.5: every
  non-deterministic edge cites a verbatim span that verifies against the source), tags the three axes,
  and returns dispositions `ACCEPTED | DEMOTED | QUARANTINED | REJECTED` with `reason` and
  `retryable` (`false` for semantic rejections, `true` for transport failures). A truncated payload
  (`complete` not `true`) is rejected with no partial write; a forged verdict or `authored_by=human`
  is **demoted** to `unverified`/`agent`, never forged (§1.4/§1.8).
- `agents/extractor.md` (subagent `kg-extractor`): reads the scrubbed source section by section and
  emits the contract JSON — nodes, pack-typed edges, and a verbatim supporting span per edge — to
  `mcp__creativity-graph__kg_write`.
- **Exit test:** `pytest tests/test_invariants.py` — fabricated/undeclared/span-less edges are
  rejected or demoted; truncated JSON is rejected; a seeded secret never leaves the scrubber.

### Stage 4 — Extraction evaluation (`f4_probe`)

- Added `scripts/f4_probe.py` (verbatim from Appendix A; standard library only): `summary` to
  inspect, `sheet --n --out` to emit the labeling CSV, `score` to compute **precision** (exit gate
  ≥ 0.70), the astrology rate (fabricated+vague), the span-support rate, precision per relation, and
  a confidence-calibration check.
- `agents/annotator.md` (subagent `kg-annotator`): labels a sample of extracted edges
  `correct | fabricated | vague | wrong_type` and records `span_found` (`y|n`), judged strictly
  against the source — producing the gold CSV `f4_probe score` consumes.
- **Exit test:** `python scripts/f4_probe.py score labels.csv` prints precision; on a miss the pack
  and extractor prompt auto-iterate (≤ 3) and the best result is recorded — the plan never halts on a
  metric (§4).

### Stage 5 — Projector + derived layer + query surface

- `scripts/kg_engine/projector.py`: `Projector(canon, derived_dir).project(incremental=True)`
  renders the canon to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/derived/graph.json` (NetworkX node-link interchange) +
  `index.sqlite`. Runs Leiden communities (`leidenalg`, label-propagation fallback); precomputes,
  off the hot path, indexed local **degree** (the cheap advisory) and a labelled **structural-bridge**
  signal (nodes joining ≥2 communities, §1.4/§1.6). Reprojection is incremental from the git diff
  `built_from_commit..HEAD`; a mismatch marks SQLite stale. **The derived layer contains nothing the
  canon does not (§1.2).**
- `scripts/kg_engine/server.py`: the read/query surface — `query_graph`, `get_node`, `get_neighbors`,
  `shortest_path`, and `kg_context(query, budget=2000)`, which reads precomputed ranks O(1) (never
  computing centrality in-request), carries provenance + epistemic tier, is hard-capped to a token
  budget (filled grounded → span-present → inferred), and surfaces
  `falsification_counters.failed_or_rejected_edges` plus a labelled `structural-bridge` advisory.
- `hooks/precontext.py`: a `PreToolUse` hook biasing the session toward the graph (query-first).
- Commands `commands/kg-build.md` (`/kg-build`) and `commands/kg-query.md` (`/kg-query`) orchestrate
  extract → write → project and answer questions with provenance + falsification counters attached.
- **Exit test:** `pytest tests/test_projector.py` — `graph.json` round-trips through NetworkX, a
  one-edge incremental reproject touches only that edge, `kg_context` returns within budget,
  `get_neighbors`/`shortest_path` are correct on a fixture graph.

### Stage 6 — Grounding loop + adversarial grounder + memory of failures

- `mcp__creativity-graph__kg_ground(target_id, verdict, by, kind, note)` — the **only** way to set a
  verdict (`grounded | rejected | failed | obsolete`), stamping `verdict_by`/`verdict_at` and an audit
  record; verdicts survive reprojection via the reconciler (§1.8).
- `agents/grounder.md` (subagent `kg-grounder`): walks the `unverified` edge queue, re-verifies each
  span, checks the relation is specific (rejects edges "true" only because generic/unfalsifiable, the
  generality confound, §1.6), and applies verdicts through `kg_ground`.
- `agents/adversarial-grounder.md` (subagent `kg-adversarial-grounder`): for each hub candidate,
  generates the strongest counter-edges and falsifying questions as typed `attacked_by` edges and
  `kg_ground(verdict="failed")`, bounded by a per-run cap.
- Memory of failures (§1.7): `rejected`/`failed` edges are non-regenerable negative information —
  never pruned by the projector, surfaced in `kg_context` as falsification counters.
- Command `commands/kg-ground.md` (`/kg-ground`) drives the grounding + adversarial passes.
- **Exit test:** `pytest tests/test_grounding.py` — the grounder drains a fixture queue, a verdict
  survives a full reproject, the adversarial grounder emits counter-edges for a seeded hub, and a
  `failed` edge survives a pruning pass and appears as a counter in `kg_context`.

### Stage 7 — Annotation agreement + specificity harness

- `scripts/kg_engine/harness.py` `agreement(...)`: Krippendorff's α across **independent**
  annotator label sets over the same edge sample (CLI consumes a JSON list of coder dicts with labels
  `correct|fabricated|vague|wrong_type`). α ≥ 0.67 ⇒ the grounding signal is treated as reliable.
- `harness.py` `specificity(...)`: compares specificity-weighted betweenness against raw degree and
  raw betweenness and emits the bridge-metric gate verdict (JSON). The real bridge metric stays
  **gated** until the harness validates it; degree + the labelled structural-bridge signal remain the
  honest advisory (§1.6).
- **Exit test:** `python -m kg_engine.harness agreement && python -m kg_engine.harness specificity`
  print α and the metric verdict; the outcome is logged and execution proceeds (§4).

### Stage 8 — Ideation comparison

- `harness.py` `ideation(...)`: scores three conditions — **control** (no graph), **graph**
  (`kg_context` + the structural-bridge advisory), **RAG** (flat retrieval over the same source) — on
  a fixed prompt set, with labels withheld then revealed, scoring diversity/novelty/apparent utility
  and flagging unsupported claims (CLI consumes `{"outputs": {"control":[…], "graph":[…], "rag":[…]},
  "source": "<text>"}`).
- Command `commands/kg-experiment.md` (`/kg-experiment`) runs and reports the comparison.
- **Exit test:** `python -m kg_engine.harness ideation` prints the per-condition table plus a verdict;
  the result is logged and execution proceeds (§4).

### Stage 9 — Hardening + packaging + component layer

- Full suite green (`pytest tests/`): crash recovery, stale-lock, OOB-verdict, ID fuzzing, truncated
  payload, scrub leakage (`tests/test_chaos.py`, `test_invariants.py`, `test_grounding.py`,
  `test_projector.py`, `test_pack.py`, `test_harness.py`).
- **Component layer wired here** — the markdown that connects the session to the engine:
  - **Agents:** `extractor.md` (`kg-extractor`), `grounder.md` (`kg-grounder`),
    `annotator.md` (`kg-annotator`), `adversarial-grounder.md` (`kg-adversarial-grounder`),
    `evaluator.md` (`kg-evaluator`).
  - **Commands:** `/kg-build`, `/kg-ground`, `/kg-query`, `/kg-eval`, `/kg-experiment` — orchestrate the
    agents via the `Task` tool and the MCP tools.
  - **Skill:** `skills/creativity-graph/SKILL.md` (the build → ground → query operating guide) with
    on-demand `references/` (`contract.md`, `pack-schema.md`, `tools.md`).
  - **Hooks:** `hooks/hooks.json` wiring `SessionStart` (`bootstrap.sh`) and `PreToolUse`
    (`precontext.py`).
- **Exit test:** `pytest tests/` fully green and `claude plugin validate ./creativity-graph --strict`
  passes; a clean install lists every component (skills, agents, hooks, MCP server).

### Packaging hardening + live validation (v0.1.0)

After `claude plugin validate --strict` passed, the plugin was installed locally — user scope, via a
single-plugin `marketplace.json` — and the full workflow run end-to-end **through the installed plugin**
on a fresh vault: `/creativity-graph:kg-build` → `/kg-ground` → `/kg-query`. (Plugin commands are
namespaced `/creativity-graph:<command>`.) Running it for real surfaced four packaging/quality bugs that
static review could not — each fixed and re-verified:

- **MCP tool namespace.** A plugin-bundled server's tools are namespaced
  `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>` (here `mcp__plugin_creativity-graph_creativity-graph__kg_write`),
  **not** `mcp__creativity-graph__kg_write`. Every agent `tools:` / command `allowed-tools:` grant (and
  doc reference) used the short form, so the `kg-extractor` subagent received no graph tools. Swept all
  references to the correct prefix.
- **userConfig → server environment.** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*}` does **not** expand inside `.mcp.json`
  (only `${user_config.KEY}`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT|DATA}`, `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` do), and two
  self-referential `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` mappings were *clobbering* the values Claude Code auto-injects
  — so the server saw no source and rejected every span. `KG_SOURCE_PATH` now uses
  `${user_config.source_path}`; sensitivity/metrics_mode come from the auto-injected `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*`.
- **Cold-start spawn race.** Pointing `.mcp.json` `command` straight at
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/.venv/bin/python` let a first-session spawn fail before the `SessionStart` hook
  finished building the venv; Claude Code cached that as "needs-auth" and dropped every `kg_*` tool for the
  session. The server now launches via **`scripts/launch_server.sh`** (bash always exists → the MCP spawn
  always succeeds; the wrapper self-heals the venv before `exec`'ing the server).
- **`kg_context` query matching.** A natural-language `/kg-query` matched the *whole* question string as one
  `LIKE` substring and returned zero items (the command fell back to structural lookups). `kg_context` now
  **tokenizes the query and OR-matches each term** (≥3 chars, deduped) across source/target/relation/span;
  single-term and empty queries are unchanged; a no-match query still returns nothing.
- **Manifest.** `userConfig` does not support `enum`/`options` (rejected by `--strict`) — dropped them; set
  `version 0.1.0`; `source_path` is a `file`-typed option. Added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

**Live results (demo corpus, fresh vault):**

- `/kg-build` — 31 ACCEPTED / 0 DEMOTED / 0 QUARANTINED / 0 REJECTED; **18 nodes, 12 edges**, every edge
  `span-present` with a verifying verbatim span; egress `kg_scrub` ran (0 redactions, PII-free demo).
- `/kg-ground` — queue drained `unverified 12 → 0`: **11 grounded, 1 rejected** (the generality confound —
  a generic definitional gloss correctly refused, §1.6), **2 failed** (adversarial counter-edges that did
  not hold). `falsification_counters.failed_or_rejected_edges = 3`, never pruned; verdicts survive a full
  reprojection (reconciler re-attach).
- `/kg-query` — answered with `[provenance/epistemic_state]` on every edge and the falsification counters
  attached; **refused to present the rejected `bridges` claim as fact**, and labelled the structural-bridge
  advisory as a heuristic.
