# PROGRESS — creativity-graph build log

One line per stage with its exit-test result and any recorded metric.
Auditable end-to-end without re-reading code. Metric stages log the outcome and proceed; no human gate.

Corpus for all measured numbers: `examples/source.md` (the self-contained demo theory). Demo vault built
under `/tmp/kg-demo/` by driving the real engine (boundary → canon → projector → grounding → harness).

| Stage | Exit test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Scaffold + env bootstrap | `claude plugin validate --strict`; MCP `kg_ping` | PASS — manifest, `.mcp.json`, cross-platform SessionStart provisioning (`provision.mjs` → `bootstrap.py`, background, `uv`-or-`venv+pip`), `kg_ping` stub all present |
| 1 — Canon + transactional writes + lease lock + reconciler | `pytest tests/test_chaos.py -q` | PASS — crash-mid-write recovers via git; stale lock reclaimed; out-of-band forged verdict re-quarantined |
| 2 — Domain pack + glossary | `python -m kg_engine.pack validate pack/pack.yaml examples/source.md` | PASS — `PackContract` valid: 6 node_types, 10 edge_types, 12 glossary terms; source_coverage 1.0, glossary_grounded_in_source 1.0 |
| 3 — Staged extractor + boundary + PII scrubber | `pytest tests/test_invariants.py tests/test_scrub_egress.py -q` | PASS — fabricated/undeclared/span-less edges rejected/demoted; truncated JSON rejected with no partial write; seeded secret never leaves via `kg_scrub`; placeholder spans restored to original in the canon (§1.9 wired live) |
| 4 — Extraction evaluation | `python scripts/f4_probe.py score labels.csv` | **precision 1.00** (gate ≥ 0.70 ✓); astrology rate 0.00; **span-support 1.00**; 12 edges labeled, per-relation `grounds` 3/3. A span-present boundary makes fabrication unreachable, so in-graph precision is high by construction. |
| 5 — Projector + derived layer + query surface | `pytest tests/test_projector.py -q` | PASS — `graph.json` round-trips through NetworkX (20 nodes / 12 edges); 8 Leiden communities; incremental reproject touches only changed edges; `kg_context` within budget (1095/2000 tok), reads precomputed ranks O(1), never computes centrality in-request |
| 6 — Grounding loop + adversarial grounder + memory of failures | `pytest tests/test_grounding.py -q` + live demo | PASS — **12/12 edges grounded** via `kg_ground`; verdicts **survive a full reproject** (12 reattached, 0 orphaned); 0 failed/rejected on this curated corpus; the `failed`-state survival + falsification-counter path is pinned by `test_grounding.py` |
| 7 — Annotation agreement + specificity harness | `python -m kg_engine.harness agreement && … specificity` | LOGGED — **Krippendorff α = 0.000** on the 12-edge sample (raw agreement 11/12; α is degenerate under extreme label prevalence — the α-paradox — so the grounding signal **stays advisory**); **specificity gate OFF** (generality_confound_detected=false, rank_churn 0.0 → specificity-weighting does not clearly separate on this small graph; degree remains the honest advisory) |
| 8 — Ideation comparison | `python -m kg_engine.harness ideation` | LOGGED — see table below; verdict: *graph condition did not clearly beat control* on the harness's diversity/novelty test, **but** the graph arm cut the unsupported-claim rate ~4× (0.083 vs 0.333) and raised utility (0.367 vs 0.167). The novelty metric (1 − source-overlap) rewards untethered text, so control "wins" novelty by inventing; the graph arm trades raw novelty for grounding. Logged; execution proceeds. |
| 9 — Hardening + packaging | `pytest tests/ -q`; `claude plugin validate --strict` | PASS — full suite **green (67 tests)**; **`claude plugin validate --strict` ✔ passes**; version `0.1.0`; component layer (5 agents, 5 commands, skill + 3 references) authored, adversarially verified against the engine source, and cross-checked (every example span verifies; every edge-id canonical; every `subagent_type` resolves). **Installed locally and the full `/kg-build` → `/kg-ground` → `/kg-query` workflow run end-to-end through the installed plugin** (see *Live validation* below). Previously-deferred items now landed (see *Stage 9 deferred items* below): headless `--backend` extraction path (`kg_engine.backend`, §2.2), edges-per-KB injection rate-limit, hardened canon path resolver (logical chroot), and CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` + `scripts/validate_plugin.py`). Still deliberately manual: public marketplace publish/`claude plugin tag` (an outward-facing human action — see `CLAUDE.md`). |
| Review — findings hardening | `pytest tests/ -q`; multi-agent review (each finding adversarially verified) | PASS — surfaced **2 invariant bypasses** (span-present via a forged `authored_by=deterministic` claim; the mtime-spoof re-hash sweep was never actually run) plus a range of correctness/robustness defects. All fixed; suite **green (79 tests; +12 regression in `tests/test_review_fixes.py`)**. Highlights: content-aware `is_stale` (a `kg_ground` verdict is visible to reads with no intervening commit), `MultiDiGraph` projection (parallel typed edges survive `graph.json`), reconciler audit-record **consumption** (a replayed verdict is caught), `kg_rename` data-safety, scrubber placeholder namespace + secret-regex coverage, and the lease lock now actually acquired. See `CHANGELOG.md` → *Review-findings hardening pass*. |

## Stage 8 ideation table (real harness output, demo corpus)

| condition | n | diversity | novelty | utility | unsupported_rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| control | 6 | 1.000 | 0.992 | 0.167 | 0.333 |
| graph   | 6 | 0.913 | 0.613 | 0.367 | **0.083** |
| rag     | 6 | 0.963 | 0.491 | 0.233 | 0.000 |

Verdict: `graph condition did NOT clearly beat control`. Honest reading: the graph condition is the most
*grounded* (4× fewer unsupported claims than control) and most *useful* (causal/connective density), but the
diversity/novelty gates favor the source-untethered control. Idea-generation value remains a hypothesis under
test (§1.1) — measured, labelled, not shipped as a guarantee.

## Definition-of-done numbers (this corpus)

- extractor precision: **1.00**  ·  span-support rate: **1.00**  ·  astrology (fabricated+vague): **0.00**
- annotation Krippendorff α: **0.000** (degenerate under 11/12 prevalence; signal stays advisory)
- specificity-metric verdict: **gate OFF** (degree is the honest advisory; specificity-weighted betweenness stays gated)
- ideation comparison: table above — graph arm most grounded/useful, not most "novel" by the diversity metric
- test suite: **267 passing** (`pytest tests/ -q`)

## Live validation (installed plugin, fresh vault)

The plugin was installed locally (user scope, via a single-plugin `marketplace.json`) and the full
workflow run end-to-end **through the installed plugin** — `/creativity-graph:kg-build` → `/kg-ground` →
`/kg-query` on a fresh vault (`/tmp/kg-vault`). Driving it for real surfaced and fixed four packaging/quality
bugs static review could not (committed):

1. **MCP tool namespace** — plugin tools are `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>`, not `mcp__<server>__`;
   the corrected grants let the `kg-extractor` subagent reach the boundary.
2. **userConfig env wiring** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*}` doesn't expand in `.mcp.json` and was clobbering
   the auto-injected values; `KG_SOURCE_PATH` now uses `${user_config.source_path}` so the server reads the source.
3. **Cold-start spawn race** — the server now launches via `node scripts/launch_server.mjs` (Node always
   exists in the Claude Code runtime → spawn never fails → no spurious "needs-auth" caching; the launcher
   self-heals the venv in the foreground via `bootstrap.py`).
4. **`kg_context` query matching** — tokenize + OR-match terms so a natural-language `/kg-query` hits
   (was a 0-item whole-string `LIKE` miss).

Live run results:

- **`/kg-build`** — 31 ACCEPTED / 0 rejected; 18 nodes, 12 span-present edges; egress `kg_scrub` ran (0 redactions).
- **`/kg-ground`** — `unverified 12 → 0`: **11 grounded, 1 rejected** (generality confound caught), **2 failed**
  (adversarial counter-edges). `falsification_counters = 3`, never pruned; verdicts survive reprojection.
- **`/kg-query`** — answered with provenance + falsification counters on every edge; refused to present the
  rejected `bridges` claim as fact; labelled the structural-bridge advisory as a heuristic.

## Stage 9 deferred items (now landed)

The three items previously parked plus the explicit path-resolver hardening from the Stage 9 task list,
implemented, then hardened against a 6-dimension adversarial review (+14 tests, 53 → 67):

1. **Headless `--backend` extraction path** (`scripts/kg_engine/backend.py`, §2.2). API-key-driven
   extraction for CI / unattended runs, mirroring `agents/extractor.md`: split the source into `##`
   sections, `kg_scrub` each (egress, §1.9), call Claude (`claude-opus-4-8`, adaptive thinking,
   `output_config.format` keyed to the pack vocabulary — no removed sampling params) to get
   nodes+edges+spans, stamp the deterministic axes, and write through the **same `kg_write` boundary**.
   The API call is isolated and the client injectable, so the full pipeline is unit-tested with a fake
   client and no network (`tests/test_backend.py`). Ships as the optional `backend` extra (`anthropic`).
2. **Edges-per-KB injection rate-limit** (`boundary.py`). Net-new writable edges are capped at
   `max(64, kb·20)` across the canon; the overflow is REJECTED `rate-limited-flood` (`retryable=false`).
   Deduped edges (re-sent / already canonical) cost no budget, so idempotent `/kg-build` re-runs never
   trip it (a bug the adversarial review caught and is now regression-tested). Tunable via
   `KG_MAX_EDGES_PER_KB`; the 2.7 KB demo (~6.5 edges/KB) is far under the bar. `tests/test_hardening.py`.
3. **Hardened canon path resolver / logical chroot** (`canon.py`). `node_path` now rejects null bytes
   and asserts the resolved path stays under the canon dir (explicit vault-prefix check on top of the
   `slug()` guarantee). Covered by `tests/test_hardening.py`.
4. **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). On every push/PR: `pytest tests/`, `pack validate`, the Stage
   7/8 harness commands, and a deterministic manifest/component check (`scripts/validate_plugin.py`,
   the hard gate). A best-effort job runs the real `claude plugin validate --strict` when the CLI is
   installable.

Still deliberately **not** automated: public marketplace publish + `claude plugin tag` — an
outward-facing, hard-to-reverse human action documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

## The generative layer (v0.3.0) — generate offensively, judge defensively

The second half of the system landed: deterministic discovery mechanisms propose `hypothesized`
candidates into a separate write lane (`kg_propose`), and the existing grounding loop is the post-hoc
filter (promotion via `kg_ground` requires support and upgrades provenance). Six generators
(`kg_generate`: bridge §2/§4, seed §3, compression §7, regroup §8, transplant §5, ensemble §9), the
four §8 endo operations (`kg_operate`), the §14 absorption window (`kg_absorption`), the completed
specificity-weighted-betweenness bridge metric (precomputed + gated), and the `/kg-generate` +
`/kg-perturb` commands with the `kg-generator` language agent. `/kg-experiment` gained a
`graph+generate` condition. Full suite green; MCP surface = 15 tools.

### Out of scope (deliberately not built)

- **§12 temporal triad as an automated scorer.** Scoring a candidate on whether the *problem it
  addresses is still alive* needs an exogenous "is this problem fresh?" signal the repo does not have
  (citation recency, issue activity, a domain freshness feed). A future
  `kg_generate(mechanism="temporal")` would consume such an external freshness feed — e.g. a
  `derived/freshness.json` mapping node ids to a recency/decay score sourced outside the graph — and
  rank candidates by the *triad* (alive problem × novel connection × specific claim) rather than by
  structure alone. It is intentionally **not** implemented: without the exogenous signal it would
  invent the very freshness it is meant to measure. Left as a documented extension point.
- **Embedding-based candidate generation** (`metrics_mode=with_embeddings`). The structure-only path is
  the default; the embedding extra was removed in 0.2.1 and is not a dependency here.

## Faster builds (v0.4.2) — Sonnet extractor + bounded parallel waves

`/kg-build` was the slowest command: it launched one `kg-extractor` per `##` section **sequentially**, and
the extractor **inherited the session model (Opus)**, so a 19-section document meant ~19 cold-started Opus
agents each emitting a large `kg_write` payload token-by-token, one after another. The bottleneck is
output-token generation × cold-start × serial. Two changes cut wall-clock without weakening any guarantee:

- **The extractor now defaults to `model: sonnet`.** The hard guarantees (verbatim-span verification,
  pack-type validation, never-forge-a-verdict) live in the `kg_write` boundary, not the model — so a faster
  model cannot break integrity; it only risks extraction *judgment*, which the Stage-4 precision gate
  (`f4_probe`, ≥ 0.70) measures. Sonnet is the speed/quality sweet spot; Haiku is deliberately not the
  default (more quarantines on dense prose). If Sonnet ever drops below the gate, revert the extractor to
  Opus and keep the parallel speedup alone.
- **The orchestrator launches one-subagent-per-section in BOUNDED PARALLEL WAVES** of `extract_wave_size`
  (new `userConfig`, default 6, range 1–10; inline override `/kg-build <source> <wave_size>` beats config
  beats default — resolved deterministically by `kg_engine.waves.resolve_wave_size`, mirrored by the
  command's pure-Bash Step 0). **One section per subagent is preserved** — collapsing sections into one
  launch would let a span be mis-attributed across sections of the same `source_file`, undetectable by the
  boundary — so span-isolation is intact; only *how many* single-section extractors run at once changed.

**Why parallel writes are safe.** FastMCP runs sync tools directly on the MCP server's single event-loop
thread, so a wave's `kg_write` calls funnel through one process and already serialize there; the canon's
single-writer lease is only ever contended *across* processes (the detached reconcile worker / headless
backend). `Canon._acquire_lock` now does a bounded retry-with-backoff (≤ `LOCK_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT`, 30 s — well
over a full max-size wave of brief writes) so a contended writer **serializes cleanly instead of failing
fast**, while the lazy projector's read path stays strictly non-blocking. New tests cover wave-size
resolution (default/fallback/clamp/precedence + a Bash-mirror drift guard) and a full 10-writer concurrent
wave (all commit, none corrupts, none dropped). Suite green at 549 tests.
